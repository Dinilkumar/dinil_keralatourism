                    <h4>Kuttanad Backwaters </h4>
                        <p>
                            One of the best places to visit in Alleppey is Kuttanad Backwaters. This isn’t a place, it’s a phenomenon. It is a spectacular lagoon, surrounded by the beauty of lakes, rivers, canals, misty mountains and ethereal landscapes.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            The experience of floating along the pristine backwaters on a houseboat is inexplicable. You will have to live it to know it! The place is also known as the ‘Rice bowl of Kerala,’ for its stunning rice plantations. If you are in Alleppey for a day, then this place should be your entire itinerary.

               <h4>Alappuzha Beach</h4>
                 <p>
                    This is one of the most popular picnic spots in Alappuzha. The pier, which extends into the sea here, is over 137 years old. Entertainment facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to the attractions of the beach. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The remains of Alappuzha Sea Bridge also make it one of the most popular destinations for explorers, narrating the tales of those times when Alleppey was one of the most famous and important port destinations in the state of Kerala. The beach has beautiful stretches, making the visit to this beach quite ecstatic and enjoyable.

                            The largest shrine of St. Sebastian in the whole world, this church is one of the most popular Alleppey tourist places. The prestigious church was established in the 16th century and rebuilt in 1584, under Father Jacomo Fenicio, who was known to heal people with his touch.

                            Other routes are from VandiperiIt has been renovated many times in history but always it has always stood tall and strong. With its majestic architecture and proximity to the Arthunkal Beach, St. Andrew’s Basilica is probably the most popular spiritual edifice in Alleppey.

                    <p>
                        A village situated just a few kilometers from Alappuzha or Alleppey, Karumady or Karumadi is one of the amazing Alappuzha tourist places that explorers would love. The place plays a pivotal role in the history and development of Buddhism as a religion and is perhaps best known for the black granite statue of Sri Buddha. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        What makes this statue even more alluring is the fact that the left-hand side of this Sri Buddha Statue is missing. Several travelers, especially the ones who are gravely ill or have someone who is ill, come to this village and touch the feet of this Lord Buddha statue because is believed that the statue has healing powers which can be directly transferred to the healer or the victim

                <h4>Pathiramanal</h4>
                    <p>
                        Pathiramanal, which means “Sands of the Night”, is a small lake island located on the backwaters of Alappuzha in Lake Vembanad. It is a bird watcher’s paradise since it is supposed to hold approximately 91 local species of birds and 50 species of migratory birds. The location of the island is extremely scenic, making it a lovely space to observe birds and the water.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        It is also completely uninhabited so you don’t have to worry about the crowd and hawkers disrupting the beauty. However, because it is uninhabited and not a major tourist hotspot, you will find that it lacks the usual facilities that bring tourists to comfort like benches in order to sit, restrooms, and places to buy food from. Let this not be a distraction since the island is very small and can be toured within an hour, which means that you won’t necessarily be inconvenienced by the lack of facilities, especially if you go prepared.
